# Yet another literature review repository
We read with Damon Albarn playing in the background and try not to procrastinate

Papers in this repo:
- Generalized Decision Transformer https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10364.pdf
- Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02039
- Offline Reinforcement Learning as One Big Sequence Modeling Problem https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01345
- Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478 (oops too large :()
